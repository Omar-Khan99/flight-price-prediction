# Project Flight Price Prediction 
* ### This is the first project I did during Course Al of Samsung Innovation Campus
* ### It was talking about predicting the price of a flight ticket based on flight details.
* ### I did an analysis of flight data and extracted important information and visualized it that will benefit airlines.
* ### Then I created an AI model that predicted the price of a flight based on the previous data which will be integrated with an application or website and then provide travelers with the best flight options that suit them.
* ### Finally, I made a presentation to display the most important information and results of the model and tips for the airline company to improve its services
